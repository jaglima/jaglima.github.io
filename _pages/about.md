I would love to describe myself as a secret agent, soldier, explorer, linguist, ethnologist, maverick, renaissance men,  scholar, poet, translator, diplomat, controversialist, mostly self-educated and unique. But acctually, this is the description of [Richard Francis Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton), an inspiration but far away from my quotidian life.

Best,
Jesse
