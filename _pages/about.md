I would love to describe myself as a secret agent, soldier, explorer, linguist, ethnologist, maverick, renaissance men,  scholar, poet, translator, diplomat, controversialist, mostly self-educated and unique. But acctually, this is the description of [Richard Francis Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton). He is an inspiration for me, but far away from my quotidian life.

I am experienced in tackling loosely defined problems, leading and owning a results-oriented long-term research agenda, while ensuring the delivery of concrete short-term breakthroughs. I have led high-profile projects that aim to solve analytical problems using data from different sources, and mixed methods.

I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building products that change the world.
Also, working in diverse and inclusive communities creates better (and bigger) results than working individually.

I have a proven track record in all phases of Data Science craft, from the concept to production. It includes hypothesis testing, model selection, model tuning, deployment, and monitoring. I can do small and big data modeling with R and Python. Also, I design MLOps/ModelOps strategies in AWS/GCP infra.

I have been delivering all this within international teams. In these experiences, I communicated sync/async 100% in English. I worked based on Lean/Agile principles and promoted best practices in software development and governance.

Likewise, I have a taste for investigation and pioneering. I had my best times being part of inaugural teams and being the first one (more than once) in some positions where I worked. I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building breakthrough products that change the world.




Best,
Jesse
