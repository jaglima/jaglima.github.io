I am a brazilian, not so young, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and diletant backpacker. I have been lived between Sao Paulo city and the country side, where my parents still lives and where I grew up.

I like living outside and doing stuff outside home.

I studied Meteorology with a MSc in Computer Science, but I didn't fully fitted in the academy. Actually, I like at most going after the theory and methods needed to build the things than the opposite. Usually, starting from the theory doesn't thrill as much. 

Professionally, I have a taste for investigation and pioneering. I had my best times being part of inaugural teams and being the first one (more than once) in some positions where I worked. I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building breakthrough products that change the world.

Another personal trait is my interest in tackling loosely defined problems. I had my higher impact performance pursuing a results-oriented long-term agenda while ensuring the delivery of concrete short-term breakthroughs. I have led high-profile projects that aim to solve analytical problems using data from different sources, and mixed methods.

I have been delivering all this within international teams. In these experiences, I communicated sync/async 100% in English. I worked based on Lean/Agile principles and promoted best practices in software development and governance.

After all this, I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building, exploring and discovering. 




Best,
Jesse
