[work in progress]

Truth is not only found through inner contemplation but also, and surely mostly, through action. It is done by inflicting yourself onto the world and seeing how the world reacts to your assaults.

I read this tweet some time ago, and I had a realization. This is the way of the ordinary man. It is a handsome way to say "stop asking and do something". Perhaps, due to our cultural, educational, and historical influences, we always want to approach reality only and only after having figured out analitically what to do. 

Perhaps it is only the way of the genius. The ordinary man must try. It frees us from the necessity to be a genius, to have a revelation to act.
