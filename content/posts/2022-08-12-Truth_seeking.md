Truth is not only found through inner contemplation but also (perhaps the mostly) though action. It is done by inflicting yourself onto the world and seeing how the world reacts against your assalts.

I read this twitt some time ago and it stroke me up. It is a handsome way to say "stop asking and do something". Perhaps, due our cultural, educational and historical influences, we always want to approach the reality only and only after having figured out analitically what to do. 

Perhaps it is only the way of the genius. The ordinary man (including myself in this class) must to try. It free us from the necessity to be a genius, to have a revelation to act.
