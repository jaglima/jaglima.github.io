# Smart versus Big Minded

These days I stambled upon an excerpt about the indian neuroscientist [Ramachandran](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/profile/story/20110822-profile-neuroscientist-v-s-ramachandran-747233-2011-08-12) and I was hooked on a passage. It is about the Ramachandran passage through Standford. I will just reproduce it here:

<p align="center">
But Cambridge has not been wasted on him. As he says, it reinforced his love for "the Victorian romantic spirit of science", a science that is ingenious, resourceful, aesthetic and dependent on simple techniques. "In the early days of science, scientists were motivated by curiosity and science was problem-driven, not technique-driven," he says. What was the technology behind Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnestism, he asks. Just a magnet and a wire. "What did Newton need to show white light is made up of seven colours? Just two prisms.". For Ramachandran, the questio that drives him is: "What's the simples expeiriment that I can do and be sure of the answer?"
</p>

The idea that science were problem-driven rather than technique-driven is an astonishing conclusion for me. More than once, I've been hounted by this idea without being able to express it. 

The point here is that in the current industry, there are many tools needed for an application. Looking for a necessity. Techniques flourish in academy but that lacks a true application. People learn it because they are told so and jump into the reality trying to fit the reality in their conceptualizations of how the tecnique must be applyied.
