# Thoughts

Just a miscelaneous of excerpts, random thoughts and phases on stuff I believe.
Constantly working in progress.

- The bias is to underestimate the true costs of winning and to overestimate the benefits of the outcome. Most "victories" are Pyrrhic - Nassim Taleb

- The problem is not people being uneducated. The problem is that people are educated just enough to believe what they have been taught, and not educated enough to question anything from what they have been taught. - Richard Feynman

- Learn the difference between authentic advice and projection. Some people are actually sepaking to yourger versions of themselves, not to you - Anon in the internet
