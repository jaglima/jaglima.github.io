# Personal 

I decided to start this blog to fulfill some inner aspirations. The first of these aspirations is playing the Paul Graham here. I love [that blog](http://paulgraham.com/) he keeps feeding year after year and thought I could build one by my own. The second reason is that a Twitter account, LinkedIn, and even Instagram don't meet my needs for creating a personal space predominantly focused on text and sheltered from the noise of social media.

I am a Brazilian technology professional, not so young, and an occasional backpacker. For most of my life, I have lived between the city of SÃ£o Paulo and the countryside, where I grew up and where my parents still live.

I enjoy being outdoors, going to the gym, indulging in good food and beer. In my free time, I engage in various small obsessions depending on how life presents them to me. These can range from woodworking to brazilian government bonds, from lifting weights to a fascination for the [Richard Francis Burton](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton) biography.  


# Academic

I studied Meteorology with a major in Computer Science. Then I pursued a MSc in Computer Science. Since my MSc experience I keep studying here and there in an independent way. After some time between academia and industry I discovered that I like at most going after the theory and methods aiming to build things than the opposite. So, I'm frequently engaged in research and experimentally stuff but not necessarily inside pure research. 

# Professional

I have a taste for investigation and pioneering. I had my best times being part of inaugural teams, being the first one (more than once) in some positions where I worked. 

I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building breakthrough products and teams that change the world. They are the key components in building, exploring and discovering.

Another personal trait is my interest in tackling loosely defined problems. I had my higher impact performance pursuing a results-oriented long-term agenda while ensuring the delivery of concrete short-term breakthroughs. I have led high-profile projects that aim to solve analytical problems using data from different sources, and mixed methods.

I have been delivering all this within international teams. In these experiences, I communicated sync/async 100% in English. I worked based on Lean/Agile principles and promoted best practices in software development and governance.


Best, Jesse
