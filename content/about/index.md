# Personal 

I am a Brazilian technologist, not so young, and an occasional backpacker. For most of my life, I have lived between the city of SÃ£o Paulo and the countryside, where I grew up and where my parents still reside.

I enjoy being outdoors, going to the gym, indulging in good food and beer. In my free time, I engage in various small obsessions depending on how life presents them to me. These can range from woodworking to poker playing.  

# Academic

I studied Meteorology with a major in Computer Science. Then I pursued a MSc in Computer Science. Since my MSc experience I keep studing here and there in an indepentend way. After some time between academia and industry I discovered that I like at most going after the theory and methods aiming to build things than the opposite. So, I'm frequently engaged in research and experimental stuff but not necessarilty inside pure researche. 

# Professionaly

I have a taste for investigation and pioneering. I had my best times being part of inaugural teams, being the first one (more than once) in some positions where I worked. 

I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building breakthrough products and teams that change the world. They are the key components in building, exploring and discovering.

Another personal trait is my interest in tackling loosely defined problems. I had my higher impact performance pursuing a results-oriented long-term agenda while ensuring the delivery of concrete short-term breakthroughs. I have led high-profile projects that aim to solve analytical problems using data from different sources, and mixed methods.

I have been delivering all this within international teams. In these experiences, I communicated sync/async 100% in English. I worked based on Lean/Agile principles and promoted best practices in software development and governance.


Best, Jesse
