    <p><em>TLDR</em>: I started this blog to skip the paywall in the most popular text publishers.</p>
<h1 id="personal">Personal</h1>
<p>I decided to start this blog to fulfill some inner aspirations. The first of these aspirations is playing the Paul Graham here. I love <a href="http://paulgraham.com/">that blog</a> he keeps feeding year after year and thought I could build one by my own. The second reason is that a Twitter account, LinkedIn, and even Instagram don&rsquo;t meet my needs for creating a personal space predominantly focused on text and sheltered from the noise of social media.</p>
<p>I am a Brazilian technology professional, not so young, and an occasional backpacker. For most of my life, I have lived between the city of SÃ£o Paulo and the countryside, where I grew up and where my parents still live.</p>
<p>I enjoy being outdoors, going to the gym, indulging in good food and beer. In my free time, I engage in various small obsessions depending on how life presents them to me. These can range from woodworking to brazilian government bonds, from lifting weights to a fascination for the <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> biography.</p>
<h1 id="academic">Academic</h1>
<p>I studied Meteorology with a major in Computer Science. Then I pursued a MSc in Computer Science. Since my MSc experience I keep studying here and there in an independent way. After some time between academia and industry I discovered that I like at most going after the theory and methods aiming to build things than the opposite. So, I&rsquo;m frequently engaged in research and experimentally stuff but not necessarily inside pure research.</p>
<h1 id="professional">Professional</h1>
<p>I have a taste for investigation and pioneering. I had my best times being part of inaugural teams, being the first one (more than once) in some positions where I worked.</p>
<p>I believe curiosity, tenacity, and patience are key components of building breakthrough products and teams that change the world. They are the key components in building, exploring and discovering.</p>
<p>Another personal trait is my interest in tackling loosely defined problems. I had my higher impact performance pursuing a results-oriented long-term agenda while ensuring the delivery of concrete short-term breakthroughs. I have led high-profile projects that aim to solve analytical problems using data from different sources, and mixed methods.</p>
<p>I have been delivering all this within international teams. In these experiences, I communicated sync/async 100% in English. I worked based on Lean/Agile principles and promoted best practices in software development and governance.</p>
<p>Best, Jesse</p>
